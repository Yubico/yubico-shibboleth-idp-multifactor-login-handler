MultiFactor Login Handler for use with the Shibboleth IdP.

NOTE: This project is deprecated and is no longer being maintained.

See https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/Multi+Factor+Login+Handler
( or https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/x/aYBC ) for installation instructions.

This version has been successfully tested with Shibboleth IdP versions 2.2.1
and 2.4.0, using the JAAS modules from yubico-validation-client 2.0.2-SNAPSHOT.

What is special with this Login Handler? Two things :

  1) It collects multiple authentication factors from the login servlet.

     Besides the j_username and j_password collected by the regular
     UsernamePassword login handler, we also collect
     j_tokens[0] .. j_tokens[n].

     See MultiFactorAuthLoginServlet.service().

  2) We convey all these collected factors to JAAS modules by calling the
     JAAS modules PasswordCallback.setPassword() muliple times, with
     j_password coming last (to provide some compatibility with single-
     factor JAAS modules).

     If the JAAS module wants to get more than the first factor, it must
     pass us a PasswordCallback capable of accumulating factors in
     setPassword().

     See MultiAuthCallbackHandler.handle().

See com.yubico.jaas.MultiValuePasswordCallback for an example of a multi-
factor capable PasswordCallback.

Currently known Multi Factor JAAS modules :

  com.yubico.jaas.YubikeyLoginModule	  for YubiKey OTPs
  com.yubico.jaas.HttpOathOtpLoginModule  for OATH token validations
